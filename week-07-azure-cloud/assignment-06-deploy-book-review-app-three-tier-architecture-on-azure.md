# Assignment 6 — Capstone: Deploy Book Review App (Three-Tier Architecture) on Azure

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

This is the most important assignment of the course. You will deploy the Book Review App in a production-ready, best-practice-compliant three-tier architecture on Azure: separated presentation, application, and database tiers, least-privilege network access, a controlled public entry point, protected secrets, and availability/monitoring evidence.

# Task 1 — Design the Azure Three-Tier Architecture

## Goal

Create an architecture diagram and implementation plan identifying the presentation, application, and database components, the chosen Azure services, the public entry point, and the internal traffic paths.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Architecture diagram showing the public entry point, three tiers, network boundaries, and traffic flow

#### Screenshot 2 — Written architecture assumptions and selected Azure services

# Task 2 — Create the Azure Network Foundation

## Goal

Create a dedicated Resource Group and VNet with separate subnets for the web, application, and database tiers, keeping the application and database tiers without direct public access.

### Evidence

# Task 3 — Configure Security and Secret Management

## Goal

Apply least-privilege NSG rules so traffic flows Internet → public entry point → web tier → application tier → database tier, and store credentials in Azure Key Vault or another approved secure mechanism.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — NSG rules proving least-privilege access between the tiers

# Task 4 — Deploy the Presentation (Web) Tier

## Goal

Deploy the Book Review App presentation layer on the approved web-tier compute service, configured to route requests to the internal application-tier endpoint, and not directly exposed except through the public entry service.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 8 — Web-tier compute overview showing subnet and availability configuration

#### Screenshot 9 — Terminal or service output proving the presentation layer is running

# Task 5 — Deploy the Business (Application) Tier

## Goal

Deploy the Book Review App backend privately in the application subnet, configured to use the private database endpoint and secured environment values, reachable only through its internal endpoint.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 10 — Application-tier compute overview showing private subnet placement

#### Screenshot 11 — Backend process, service, or listening-port evidence

#### Screenshot 12 — Internal health-check or API response (without exposing secrets)

![screenshot](./screenshots/Assignment6-Screenshot12.png)

# Task 6 — Deploy the Managed Database Tier

## Goal

Create a private Azure managed database (public access disabled), with availability/backup/retention settings, the Book Review App schema imported, and access restricted to the application tier only.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 13 — Database overview showing private connectivity and public access disabled

![screenshot](./screenshots/Assignment6-Screenshot13.png)

#### Screenshot 14 — Availability, backup, and retention configuration

![screenshot](./screenshots/Assignment6-Screenshot14.png)
![screenshot](./screenshots/Assignment6-Screenshot14a.png)

#### Screenshot 15 — Successful schema or connectivity verification (without exposing credentials)

![screenshot](./screenshots/Assignment6-Screenshot15.png)

# Task 7 — Configure Traffic Management, Availability, and Monitoring

## Goal

Configure the approved public entry service with health probes and backend pools, internal routing for the application tier where required, and enable Azure Monitor/diagnostics/logs/alerts for the key resources.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 16 — Public entry service showing listener, frontend endpoint, and healthy web targets

#### Screenshot 17 — Internal application-tier load-balancing or routing configuration where applicable

![screenshot](./screenshots/Assignment6-Screenshot17a.png)

#### Screenshot 18 — Azure Monitor, diagnostic settings, logs, metrics, or alert evidence

![screenshot](./screenshots/Assignment6-Screenshot19.png)

# Task 8 — Validate the Production-Style Deployment

## Goal

Confirm the Book Review App works end to end through the public endpoint, with at least one database read and one write, confirm private tiers are not internet-reachable, and complete a safe availability test.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 19 — Browser showing the Book Review App through the public endpoint

#### Screenshot 20 — Proof of successful database-backed read and write operations

![screenshot](./screenshots/Assignment6-Screenshot21.png)
![screenshot](./screenshots/Assignment6-Screenshot21a.png)

#### Screenshot 21 — Evidence that private tiers are not publicly accessible

#### Screenshot 22 — Availability-test and healthy-target evidence

### Notes

Summarize what worked, issues encountered and how they were fixed, and the availability/security/secrets/monitoring/backup choices made.

The three-tier Book Review application was successfully deployed on Azure using a secured network architecture.

Web Tier: Deployed the Next.js frontend on vm-bookreview-web in the snet-web subnet. Nginx was configured as the web server and reverse proxy.
Application Tier: Deployed the Node.js/Express backend on vm-bookreview-app in the private snet-app subnet.
Internal Load Balancer: Configured lb-bookreview-app-internal with frontend IP 10.0.2.5 and backend vm-bookreview-app (10.0.2.4) on port 3001.
Application Gateway: Configured agw-bookreview-prod as the public entry point and verified the web backend as Healthy, receiving HTTP 200 responses.
Database Tier: Azure MySQL Flexible Server was deployed using private networking in snet-data. The backend successfully connected to MySQL through the private endpoint.
Database: book_review_db was created and populated with sample books, users, and reviews.
Connectivity: Verified the complete internal path from the Web VM → Internal Load Balancer → Application VM → private MySQL database.
Health Monitoring: Application Gateway backend health and Azure Load Balancer health probes were configured and verified.
Security: The application and database tiers are not intended to be directly accessible from the public Internet. NSGs restrict traffic between the appropriate subnets and ports.
Secrets: Database credentials and JWT secrets were initially configured through environment variables. Azure Key Vault kv-bookreview-prod was also provisioned for secure secret management and should be used for the final production configuration.
Availability: Azure Load Balancer health probing is configured to remove unhealthy application instances from traffic. The current deployment has a single application/web instance, so it demonstrates health-based routing but does not provide full VM-level high availability.
Monitoring: Azure Monitor metrics, health probes, diagnostics and alerting were configured/planned to provide operational visibility.
Issues Fixed: Corrected the frontend API routing so browser requests use /api, configured Nginx to proxy /api/ to the internal application load balancer, rebuilt the Next.js production application, and verified the frontend and backend services independently.
