## Purpose

<<<<<<< HEAD
In this assignment, you will build a read-only Bash wrapper around Ansible's own `--check --diff` dry-run mode against your production-grade EpicBook inventory from Assignment 5, classify the changes it finds into risk categories, and connect it to Claude Code as a `/ansible-risk-review` skill that can analyze a pending change but must never apply the playbook itself.

---

# Task 1 — Confirm Inventory Connectivity and Set Up the Workspace

## Goal

Confirm every host in your inventory responds to a ping module check, then create the assignment workspace.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Terminal showing `ansible all -m ping` with every host reachable
=======
In this assignment, you will build an AI-assisted Ansible risk-review workflow using `ansible-playbook --check --diff`, Bash scripting, and Claude Code.

You will review possible server changes before applying them, classify risky tasks, and keep the final apply decision under human control.

---

# Task 1 — Confirm EpicBook Connectivity and Create the Workspace

## Goal

Confirm that your previous EpicBook Ansible project is working before creating the risk-review automation.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Output of `ansible web -i inventory.ini -m ping`
>>>>>>> upstream/main

Add your screenshot here.

---

<<<<<<< HEAD
# Task 2 — Add Safety Rules to CLAUDE.md

## Goal

Create a `CLAUDE.md` that defines the change-review workflow (dry run first, human approves and runs the real playbook, verify again) and explicit safety rules against Claude applying, converging, or "fixing" the playbook automatically.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — `CLAUDE.md` open showing the workflow and safety rules
=======
#### Screenshot 2 — Output of `ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini site.yml --syntax-check`
>>>>>>> upstream/main

Add your screenshot here.

---

<<<<<<< HEAD
# Task 3 — Use Agentic AI to Plan the Risk Categories

## Goal

Ask Claude Code to read `CLAUDE.md` and propose a risk-classification plan with exactly four categories — service restarts/handlers, firewall rule changes, user/sudo changes, and package or file removal — before any script exists.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — Claude Code showing the four-category risk-classification plan

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 4 — Build the Ansible Risk Review Script

## Goal

Create `ansible-check-review.sh` that runs `ansible-playbook --check --diff`, parses the task and recap output, deduplicates changed tasks so a task that changes across multiple hosts in your inventory is counted once rather than once per host, and classifies each changed task into one of the four risk categories.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Editor showing the script's task-classification functions

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 5 — Terminal showing `bash -n` passing with no syntax errors

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 5 — Run the Dry-Run Review Against the Current Playbook

## Goal

Run the script against your unmodified playbook and confirm it reports low risk with no unreachable or failed hosts.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — Terminal output showing the risk report and its overall status

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 6 — Create and Run the /ansible-risk-review Skill

## Goal

Create a Claude Code skill restricted to read-only tools that runs the script, reads the risk report, and explains which changes are risky and why — without ever running the playbook itself.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 7 — `SKILL.md` frontmatter showing `allowed-tools` with no `Write`

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 8 — `/ansible-risk-review` output for the baseline playbook

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 7 — Introduce a Risky Change and Let the Skill Catch It

## Goal

Add one task to your playbook that touches a risk category — a service restart, a firewall rule change, or a file removal — then confirm the skill flags it and recommends holding for review before you apply anything for real.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 9 — Raw dry-run output showing the new task reporting `changed`

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 10 — `/ansible-risk-review` output showing the risky finding and the recommendation to hold for review

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 8 — Apply as the Human, Verify, and Write a Change Summary

## Goal

Review the recommendation, run the playbook for real yourself (never Claude), confirm every host still responds to the ping module, run the skill again to confirm no further changes are pending, and write a short change summary.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 11 — Terminal showing the real `ansible-playbook` run applying successfully

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 12 — Second `/ansible-risk-review` output confirming no further changes are pending
=======
#### Screenshot 3 — Output of `pwd` and `find . -maxdepth 4 -type d | sort`
>>>>>>> upstream/main

Add your screenshot here.

---

### Notes

<<<<<<< HEAD
In one or two sentences, explain why `ansible-playbook --check --diff` deserves the same respect as `terraform plan`, and why the AI skill was allowed to analyze the dry-run output but never allowed to run the playbook for real.
