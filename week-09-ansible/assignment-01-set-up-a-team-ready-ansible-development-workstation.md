# Assignment 01 — Set Up a Team-Ready Ansible Development Workstation

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will prepare an isolated and reusable Ansible development workstation.

You will install Ansible and supporting tools inside a Python virtual environment, configure VS Code, prepare SSH access, configure Git and pre-commit hooks, and document the complete setup.

This workstation will be used as the Ansible controller in upcoming assignments.

# Task 1 — Create and Initialize the Ansible Workspace

## Goal

Create the assignment workspace, initialize a Git repository, prepare the required directories, and add Git ignore rules for local and sensitive files.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Terminal showing the `ansible-onboarding` path, `ls -la` output, and `git status` confirming the Git repository is on the `main` branch

# Task 2 — Create the Virtual Environment and Install Ansible Tools

## Goal

Create an isolated Python virtual environment and install Ansible and the required validation tools without modifying the system Python environment.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — Terminal showing the active `(.venv)` environment, `which ansible`, `ansible --version`, `ansible-lint --version`, `yamllint --version`, and `pre-commit --version`

# Task 3 — Configure VS Code for Ansible Development

## Goal

Configure Visual Studio Code to use the project’s Python virtual environment and provide validation support for Python, YAML, and Ansible files.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — VS Code Extensions panel showing the Ansible, YAML, and Python extensions installed

#### Screenshot 4 — VS Code showing `.vscode/settings.json` and `.editorconfig` open side by side, with the required settings clearly visible

# Task 4 — Create the Baseline Ansible Configuration

## Goal

Create a reusable `ansible.cfg` file containing the default settings that will be used in this workspace and upcoming Ansible assignments.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 5 — `ansible.cfg` open in VS Code or another editor, showing the complete configuration

![screenshot](./screenshots/Assignment1-Screenshot5.png)

#### Screenshot 6 — Terminal showing `ansible --version` with the `ansible.cfg` path and the output of `ansible-config dump --only-changed`

![screenshot](./screenshots/Assignment1-Screenshot6.png)

# Task 5 — Configure SSH Readiness

## Goal

Prepare SSH key authentication, load the key into the SSH agent, configure reusable SSH client settings, and understand how trusted host fingerprints are stored.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 7 — Terminal showing `ssh-add -l` with the ED25519 key loaded and the SSH configuration verification output

![screenshot](./screenshots/Assignment1-Screenshot7.png)

# Task 6 — Configure Git Identity and Pre-commit Hooks

## Goal

Configure your Git identity and install pre-commit hooks that validate YAML and Ansible files before commits are created.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 8 — Terminal showing your Git full name, Git email, default branch, successful `pre-commit install` output, and `.git/hooks/pre-commit`

![screenshot](./screenshots/Assignment1-Screenshot8.png)

# Task 7 — Test the Complete Workstation Setup

## Goal

Verify that Ansible, the linting tools, Git hooks, SSH agent, and Git ignore rules are working correctly.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 9 — Terminal showing `pre-commit run --all-files` completing successfully

![screenshot](./screenshots/Assignment1-Screenshot9.png)

#### Screenshot 10 — Terminal showing `ansible --version` with the project configuration path and `ssh-add -l` with the ED25519 key loaded

![screenshot](./screenshots/Assignment1-Screenshot10.png)

# Task 8 — Create the README and Onboarding Checklist

## Goal

Document the completed Ansible workstation setup and create a reusable checklist for preparing another workstation in the future.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 11 — Terminal showing the final `ansible-onboarding` project structure

![screenshot](./screenshots/Assignment1-Screenshot11.png)

#### Screenshot 12 — VS Code Markdown preview showing your full name, project summary, and part of the “New Machine? Do This” checklist

# Assignment Questions

Answer the following in your own words:

**1. What is one feature that makes your workstation setup team-friendly?**

The .pre-commit-config.yaml file makes the workstation team-friendly. It ensures that everyone uses the same YAML and Ansible linting checks before committing code. This helps maintain consistent code quality across the team.

**2. What is one pitfall you avoided while completing the setup?**

I avoided installing Ansible globally on the system. Instead, I installed it inside the project's .venv virtual environment. This prevents Python dependency conflicts with other applications and projects.

**3. Why should Ansible be installed inside a Python virtual environment?**

Ansible should be installed inside a Python virtual environment to isolate its Python dependencies from the system Python installation. This makes the environment easier to manage, prevents version conflicts, and allows different projects to use their own required package versions.

**4. Why must SSH private keys and `.venv/` remain outside version control?**

SSH private keys must remain outside version control because they are sensitive credentials. If exposed in a Git repository, someone could potentially use the key to access systems.

The .venv/ directory should remain outside version control because it contains locally installed Python packages and environment-specific files. It can be recreated from the project's dependency configuration instead of being committed to Git.
